**What is the intended use of the software? How will your software
contribute to research? (project/research_question/title):**

Neurotechnology explores the interface between the nervous system and
technology. Innovations such as brain-machine interfaces and
neuroprosthetics have the potential to restore lost functions and
enhance human capabilities. Neurotechnology is also advancing our
understanding of the brain and its disorders, paving the way for new
therapies. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines
engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Robots are
being developed for a wide range of applications, from manufacturing and
healthcare to space exploration and disaster response. Advances in
robotics are paving the way for autonomous systems that can perform
tasks with minimal human intervention.
